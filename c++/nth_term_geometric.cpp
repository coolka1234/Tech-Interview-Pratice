// Given the A and R i,e first term and common ratio of a GP series. Find the Nth term of the series.

// Note: As the answer can be rather large print its modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).

// Example 1:

// Input: A = 2, R = 2, N = 4
// Output: 16
// Explanation: The GP series is 
// 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,... in which 16 
// is th 4th term.

// Example 2:

// Input: A = 4, R = 3, N = 3
// Output: 36
// Explanation: The GP series is
// 4, 12, 36, 108,.. in which 36 is
// the 3rd term.

 

// Your Task:
// You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function Nth_term() which takes A, R and N as input parameter ans returns Nth term of the GP series modulo 109 + 7.
 

// Expected Time Complexity: O(log2(N))
// Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

// Constraints:
// 1 <= A, R, N <= 1000000
